# whatTheüç¥

This was a fun project I started with friends at a womens' Hackathon at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We did not get very far but we had a lot of fun coming up with an idea and starting it! The idea was to make a recipe generator that could filter through for dietary restrictions and other options.

We were going to parse through recipes using Java and then host this project on a web platform.
